# Dataset Preparation
Our experiments use three public HAR datasets:

1. **REALDISP**: A dataset of activities of daily living [1]
2. **REALWORLD**: A dataset capturing activities in real-world settings [2]
3. **MM-Fit**: A multi-modal fitness dataset with IMU data [3]

## Download Instructions
1. Download the three pre-processed dataset folders from our [PPDA Datasets (Box)](https://sussex.box.com/s/xxhk05jqfty6d0v9d5zfgh6hvvw8ikp9)
2. Place all three folders directly in the `data/` directory (where this README.md is located)
3. No additional processing is required!
